### Introduction to Process Injection in Windows

In my previous post, we explored the fundamentals of the Win32 API and in our first code in C++, laying a foundation for understanding how applications interact with the Windows operating system. Today, we will delve into a more advanced and exciting topic: **process injection**. This technique is commonly used in malware development to execute code within the address space of another process, allowing for stealthy operations and evasion of security mechanisms.

#### Learning Objectives
By the end of this article, you will be able to:

- Understand the concept and purpose of process injection.
- Identify and describe various process injection techniques.
- Recognize the use cases and implications of process injection in offensive development


Before Starting, we are going to recap the previous blog post
### Recap: Getting Started with Win32 API and C++ Development

Before we dive into process injection, let's quickly recap what we covered in the first article:

- Introduction to the Win32 API
- Key DLLs and their functionalities
- User Mode vs. Kernel Mode in Windows OS
- Why we use C++ ou C#
- Practical examples including the `MessageBox` function and process Enumeration example in C++.

### Understanding Process Injection

In offensive development, one of the most effective technique employed is process injection. This method has become increasingly prevalent, especially in advanced persistent threats (APTs) and sophisticated malware campaigns. Process injection involves inserting code into a running process. This can be done using various techniques, each with its own advantages and complexity. The main goal is to run arbitrary code within the context of another process like `notepad.exe` or `explorer.exe`, which can be useful for tasks like evading security measures or performing covert operations. This technique usually consists of a chain of three primitives.
1. **Allocation primitive** : Used to allocate memory
2. **Writing primitive**: Used to write malicious code to the allocated memory
3. **Execution primitive**: Used to execute the malicious code written

NB: The most basic injection technique would use the Win32 API functions VirtualAllocEX() for allocation, WriteProcessMemory() for writing, and CreateRemoteThread() for execution.


### Common Process Injection Techniques
Let's talk about some process injection techniques

#### 1. **Remote Thread Injection**

This is one of the most straightforward methods. It simply involves creating a remote thread in the target process to execute the injected code.

**Steps**:
1. Open the target process by name like `notepad.exe`  using `OpenProcess`.
2. Allocate memory in the target process using `VirtualAllocEx`.
3. Write the payload (code) into the allocated memory using `WriteProcessMemory`.
4. Create a remote thread in the target process with `CreateRemoteThread`.

**Advantages**:
* Simple to Implement
* Widely supported across different versions of windows

**Diagram**:
```scss

Process A             Process B
(malware.exe)        (notepad.exe)
  |                    |
  | OpenProcess()      |
  |------------------->|
  |                    |
  | VirtualAllocEx()   |
  |------------------->|
  |                    |
  | WriteProcessMemory()|
  |------------------->|
  |                    |
  | CreateRemoteThread()|
  |------------------->|
  |                    |
  v                    v
Code executed in Process B
```

####  2. **DLL Injection**

This technique involves injecting or loading a DLL(Library or .dll file) into the target process and executing its code.

**Steps**:
1. Open the target process.
2. Allocate memory for the DLL path in the target process.
3. Write the DLL path into the allocated memory.
4. Use `CreateRemoteThread` to call `LoadLibrary` with the DLL path as an argument.

**Advantages**:
* DLLs can be easily reused and shared.
* Allows complex functionality to be injected.
* Can easily AVs as the target process is a legitimate one

**Diagram**:
```scss

Process A              Process B
(malware.exe)        (notepad.exe)
  |                      |
  | OpenProcess()        |
  |--------------------->|
  |                      |
  | VirtualAllocEx()     |
  |--------------------->|
  |                      |
  | WriteProcessMemory() |
  |--------------------->|
  |                      |
  | CreateRemoteThread() |
  |--------------------->|
  |                      |
  v                      v
DLL loaded and executed in Process B
```

#### 3. **APC (Asynchronous Procedure Call) Injection**

We Inject a shellcode in to a remote thread then queue an `Asynchronous Procedure Call` Object to this thread within . When the thread enters an alertable state(when it calls `SleepEx`, `SignalObjectAndWait`, `MsgWaitForMultipleObjectsEx`, `WaitForMultipleObjectsEx`), the `Asynchronous Call` is executed.
This technique is similar to the Thread Hijacking technique

**Steps**:
1. Open the target process and target thread.
2. Allocate memory for the payload in the target process.
3. Write the payload into the allocated memory.
4. Queue the APC to the target thread using `QueueUserAPC`.

**Advantages**:
* Can be used to execute code in specific threads.
* Often bypasses basic security mechanisms as it reuses existing threads

**Diagram**:
```scss
Process A               Process B
(malware.exe)         (notepad.exe)
  |                        |
  | OpenProcess()          |
  |----------------------->|
  |                        |
  | OpenThread()           |
  |----------------------->|
  |                        |
  | VirtualAllocEx()       |
  |----------------------->|
  |                        |
  | WriteProcessMemory()   |
  |----------------------->|
  |                        |
  | QueueUserAPC()         |
  |----------------------->|
  |                        |
  | CreateRemoteThread()   |
  |----------------------->|
  v                        v
APC executed in Process B's thread
```

#### 4. **Process Hollowing**

In process hollowing, a new process is created in a suspended state, its memory is unmapped, and the memory of the target executable is mapped into it. Then we resume the process in suspended state.

**Steps**:
1. Create a new process (`svchost.exe`) in a suspended state using `CreateProcess`.
2. Read the .text bloc to look for image base pointer of thre created process.
3. Allocate memory for the target executable in the new process.
4. Write the target executable into the allocated memory.
5. Resume the process.

**Advantages**:
* Harder to detect as the original process name remains unchanged.
* Effective for executing large payloads.

**Diagram**:
```scss
Process A                 Process B
(malware.exe)           (svchost.exe)
  |                          |
  | CreateProcess() (suspended)|
  |-------------------------->|
  |                          |
  | ReadProcessMemory()      |
  |-------------------------->|
  |                          |
  | VirtualAllocEx()         |
  |-------------------------->|
  |                          |
  | WriteProcessMemory()     |
  |-------------------------->|
  |                          |
  | ResumeThread()           |
  |-------------------------->|
  |                          |
  v                          v
Target executable runs in Process B
```

####  5. **Thread Hijacking**

Thread hijacking involves suspending a thread in the target process, modifying its context to point to the injected code, and then resuming the thread. It's similar to process Hollowing but concerns threads only.

**Steps**:
1. Open the target process and suspend a thread using `SuspendThread`.
2. Allocate memory for the payload in the target process.
3. Write the payload into the allocated memory.
4. Modify the thread context to point to the injected code using `SetThreadContext`.
5. Resume the thread using `ResumeThread`.

**Advantages**:
* Utilizes existing threads, reducing detection risk.
* Efficient for quick code execution.

**Diagram**:
```scss
Process A                    Process B
(malware.exe)              (notepad.exe)
  |                            |
  | OpenProcess()              |
  |--------------------------->|
  |                            |
  | SuspendThread()            |
  |--------------------------->|
  |                            |
  | VirtualAllocEx()           |
  |--------------------------->|
  |                            |
  | WriteProcessMemory()       |
  |--------------------------->|
  |                            |
  | SetThreadContext()         |
  |--------------------------->|
  |                            |
  | ResumeThread()             |
  |--------------------------->|
  |                            |
  v                            v
Hijacked thread runs injected code in Process B
```

#### 6. **Inter-Process Mapping Section**

This technique involves creating a new memory section and mapping a view of this section locally. The shellcode is copied into the local mapped view, and a remote mapped view of this local view is then created in the target process. So the first map is only used for alteration and the second map for execution to avoid suspucious memory space. Finally, a new thread is created in the target process with the mapped view as its entry point..

**Steps**:
1. Create a section object using `CreateFileMapping`.
2. Map the section into the address space of the current process using in Read and Write protection `MapViewOfFile`.
3. Write the payload into the allocated memory.
4. Open the target process.
5. Map the section into the address space of the target process using in Read and Execute protection  `MapViewOfFile2`.
6. Create a remote thread in the target process with `CreateRemoteThread`.

**Advantages**:
* Efficient for large data transfers.
* Provides a persistent communication channel between processes.
* Helps to avoid AV as the first mapped memmory are only in Read & Write (RW) protection and the second is on Read & Execute(RX) protection. (No Read, Write & Execute Simultaneously -> No RWX)

**Diagram**:

```scss
Process A                       Process B
  |                             |
  | CreateFileMapping()         |
  |---------------------------->|
  |                             |
  | MapViewOfFile(RW)           |
  |---------------------------->|
  |                             |
  | VirtualAllocEx()            |
  |---------------------------->|
  |                             |
  | WriteProcessMemory()        |
  |---------------------------> | 
  |                             |
  | OpenProcess()               |
  |---------------------------->|
  |                             |
  | MapViewOfFile2(RX)          |
  |---------------------------->|
  |                             |
  | CreateRemoteThread()        |
  |---------------------------->|
  |                             |
  v                             v
Shared memory accessible in both processes
```

#### 7. **Other Injection Techniques**

There are other injection techniques more sophisticated like Reflective DLL Injection, Atom Bombing, Process Doppel Ganging, etc.
But one blog article can't be enough to present all theses techniques.
