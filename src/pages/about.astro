        I perform penetration tests and offensive security tasks in my daily job. 
        <br>To enhance my skills, I've set myself the challenge of writing posts and sharing knowledge, including publishing tools and scripts during my spare time.
        <br> My current certifications are : OSCP, CRTP, CRTE, (OSEP Soon ^^)
        <br><br>
        One of the things that really encouraged me to create this blog is my recent interest in malware development in Windows using C#. The Udemy course "Offensive C#" by Naga Sai Nikhil played a significant role in inspiring me to share my knowledge and experiences in this field.
        <br><br>
        To ensure we're on the same page, this blog primarily focuses on:
        <ul class="list-disc mx-6 mb-10 grid gap-2">

            <li> Penetration testing</li>
            <li> Red Teaming & C2</li>
            <li> Malware Development</li>
            <li> Active Directory Attacks</li>
            <li> Other cool Stuff</li>
        </ul>
       
        I hope you enjoy the content and that I can inspire others in the Infosec community with these articles, just as many others have inspired me over the years.
